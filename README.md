# DOUBLEDOT

Nicknames and package shorthands that might actually work.

Born of half a week of having to deal with multiple Java classes with the same package but a different name, and of half an evening of spare time (the 80% of it, that is).

Never worry about that again! With only a bit of flagrant violation of Clojure's reserved symbols rules you too can experience the joy of `nicknames` for classes and `shorthands` for packages that work (almost) everywhere! If you aren't feeling adventurous or you just want your subforms to still make sense in isolation, there also is a reader macro to apply to single symbols that sadly makes the name of this library meaningless.

Pre-Alpha.
